# The MechanicsCore item registry is *very* primitive. Imagine you have 'steel'
# and 'steel_sheet' as 2 custom items. When MechanicsCore first loads,
# 'steel_sheet' will actually be broken since 'steel' doesn't exist yet. To fix
# this, we loop a few times until no errors occur. If you have a *highly
# complex* crafting system, then you may want to raise this number. You should
# never need to lower it.
