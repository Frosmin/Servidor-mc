ModernTextFormation:
  # When enabled, parses (deserializes) language messages to Spigot TextComponent(s) on plugin load.
  # When disabled, parses (deserializes) language texts to Spigot TextComponent(s) in runtime when sending it to player.
  # Enabling this setting is good for performance, however messages with placeholders will be recompiled in runtime anyway.
  # (Side Note) Unlike NexEngine, it does not uses regex anymore, which makes deserialization significantly faster and accurate.
